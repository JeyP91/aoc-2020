== Day 13: Shuttle Search ==

My favorite challange in this year so far!

Rust solution for https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/13[AoC 2020, Day 13]

Run solution with `cargo run` (or `cargo run --release` to see the effect of compiler optimization)

Run tests with `cargo test`

=== Solution ===

Part 1 is straight forward:

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=find_earliest_departure]
----

Part 2 is more tricky.
I solved it using the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm[Extended Euclidean Algorithm] to compute the multiplicative inverse of an integer modulo another integer.

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=find_time]

I find it quite amazing that the solution only takes a couple of microseconds.

I have to admit it took me quite a while to get the algorithm right.
In addition to test driven development, properly writing down your algorithm before you try to encode it in an iterator adaptor definitely helps.
