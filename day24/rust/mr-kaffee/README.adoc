Rust solution for https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24[AoC 2020, Day 24]

Run solution with `cargo run` (or `cargo run --release` to see the effect of compiler optimization)

Run tests with `cargo test`

=== Solution ===

I use `(x, y)` coordinates where adjacent columns (east/west) have a distance of two and adjacent rows have a distance of 1 in `y` direction and all tiles have an offset of +/- 1 in `x` direction.

The first step is to read the input and map every line to the coordinates the path leads to:

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=get_coords]
----

For part one, I add all the coordinates to a set.
If a coordinate is seen for the second time, it is removed again.

include::src/lib.rs[tags=flip_tiles]

For part two, I apply update steps repeatedly.
