== Day 24: Lobby Layout ==

This solution is written in Kotlin.

The original puzzle can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24

 $ kotlin day2024_1_2.kts
 
=== First Star

How does it work: +

First part is reading and preparing the puzzle input. Each tile is stored with it's position in a map and the value of it's occurency in the instructions. 

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2024_1_2.kts[tags=read_puzzle_input_24]
....

After that, you only have to count all positions with uneven occurency.

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2024_1_2.kts[tags=lobby_layout]
....

=== Second Star

How does it work: +

For the second part I reused the algorithm of day17, enhance grid by additional positions at the edge, then apply the rules. After 100 repetitions, count all black tiles.

[source, kotlin, numbered]
....
include::day2024_1_2.kts[tags=lobby_layout_2]
