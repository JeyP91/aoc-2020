== What I learned

. Non-orthogonal axes.

== Approach

. I read in the data and "process" it.
.. I just regex over the 6 directions and each line into a list.
.. I define the direction "east" to be x and "northeast" to be y.
"northwest" and "southeast" can be built with combos of ne and sw.
. Problem 1:
.. You just follow the patterns to find the (x=e, y=ne) tiles. Then put that list into a set.
And if the patterns in that set are present 1 time (mod 2) then you count them.
. Problem 2:
.. Modified my previous Game of Life code. Each tile now has 6 neighbors.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
