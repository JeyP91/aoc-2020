== Day 4: Passport Processing ==

Run solution with `cargo run`

Run tests on example data with `cargo test`

=== Solution ===

Today I was struggling with the question: how to implement the singleton pattern in Rust.
The ownership and borrowing system does not make this an easy task.
I wanted to only compile the regular expressions I use for passport validity checking once ..., and I kind of failed to do so.

The compromise I ended up with was to define a `Checker` struct, which I re-use to check all the passports.
Not really a singleton though.

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/main.rs[tags=count_valid]

Here's the implementation for Checker:
