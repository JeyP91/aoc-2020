Java solution for https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/23[AoC 2020, Day 23]

=== Solution ===

Java solution today, since I had troubles creating linked lists in Rust.

Solution idea: create a linked list where each item has a reference to the next item, and the item with the next lower value.
The reference to the next item is updated in the game.
The references to the next lower value is kept to find the destination element quickly in each round.

This solution is much easier than copying around parts of arrays...

The list items are a separate class.
