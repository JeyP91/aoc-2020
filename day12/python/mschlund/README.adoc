== Day 11

This solution is written in python.

Run using:

$ python solution.py

We will store the robot's map in a huge 2d-array (yes this is very very dirty ...)
To get a ridiculous upper bound on its size we take all "F"s of the input and sum them up:

$ grep -E "F([0-9]+)" input.txt | cut -d "F" -f2 | paste -sd+ | bc
10665
So an array of size 22.000 where the origin is in the middle suffices for this exercise.
