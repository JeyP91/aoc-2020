50 Stars collected! Vacation on that nice tropical island ready to start!

1. Read two public keys from a file
2. Determine the loop size for the second public key with linear search (function `find_loop_size`)
3. Transform the first public key with that loop size (function `transform`)

The last two steps are combined in function `get_encryption_key`
