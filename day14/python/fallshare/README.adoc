== Day 14: Docking Data

Star 1 was quite straightforward.
For Star 2 I decided to use a recursive funtion to create all possible permutations of the address.
I struggeled a little bit with the datatype turning strings into lists into integers into whatever.
But since I am already 7 days behind I decided to not refactor my code and to continue with day 15.
