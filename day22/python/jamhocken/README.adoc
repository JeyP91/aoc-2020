== What I learned

. This one was straightforward.

== Approach

. I read in the data and "process" it.
.. I put each of the decks into a list.
. Problem 1:
.. Straightforward. Pop the cards, compare them, put them at the end of the right deck. Repeat until a deck is empty.
. Problem 2:
.. Like problem 1.
.. Implemented infinite loop protection with a list of tuples of lists.
.. Added check for recursive combat and recursively called using slices of the decks.
.. I put a switch into the function call, since in the outerloop, I only need the winning deck.  In any inner loop, I only need the winner.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
