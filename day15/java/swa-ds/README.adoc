:day: Day15
= {day}

To run the program, you need JDK 11.
Thanks to http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP 330], launching is as easy as `java {day}.java`.

== Part I


[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=mainPart1]
----

In part I we just look up the last occurrence by going back in the array until we find it:

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=part1]
----

== Part II

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=mainPart2]
----

The brute force version from Part I does not work since it takes way too long.
Therefore another approach is used where the turn number of the number's last occurrence is saved in a map:

[source,java, linenums]
----
include::{day}.java[tags=part2]
----
