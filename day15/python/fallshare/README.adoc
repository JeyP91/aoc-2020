== Day 15: Rambunctious Recitation

=== Star 1
I decided to use a dictionary to keep track of all mentioned numbers.
I further decided to store the history how often a number is called in a list that acts as the value in the dictionary.

=== Star 2
Oh well. Let's do a performance check of the algorithm that I have developed for Star 1.
Heavily playing around with lists and dicitonaries might be not the best choice if performance is a concern.
But I can tell that my algorithm will terminate in a finite time.
Hence I decided to not refactor it and instead I waited for the required result.
