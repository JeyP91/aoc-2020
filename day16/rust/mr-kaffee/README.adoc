== Day 16: Ticket Translation ==

Rust solution for https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16[AoC 2020, Day 16]

Run solution with `cargo run` (or `cargo run --release` to see the effect of compiler optimization)

Run tests with `cargo test`

=== Solution ===

The most difficult part for the first star was to parse the input correctly:

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=parse]
----

In the second part of the puzzle, I struggled a bit with the fact that in my puzzle input, there is a field for which no rule applies consistently for all passes.
My assumption was, that this is a bug in my solution, which I was trying to figure out for a while, before I realized that all the "departure" fields were already uniquely identified.
Since AoC accepted my answer, its maybe not a bug?

[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=find_fields]
----

Once the matrix of candidates is constructed, it is reduced as follows:
[source,rust,numbered]
----
include::src/lib.rs[tags=reduce_1d]
----
