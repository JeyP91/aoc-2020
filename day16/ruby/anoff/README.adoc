Puzzle: https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16[Ticket Translation]

== Part 1

Decided to go class-based again.
Created a class for `Rule` and a superclass `RuleSet` that contains multiple rules.
To make the number checking more efficient I decided to create an Array that holds all the valid values from all rules.
This made checking the individual tickets very fast as it only required a bit precomputation once.
