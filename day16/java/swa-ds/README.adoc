:day: Day16
= {day}

To run the program, you need JDK 11.
Thanks to http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP 330], launching is as easy as `java {day}.java`.

== Solution

Part I was easy, but Part II has given me quite some headaches.
There was one nasty ticket whose only invalid value was 0.
Since first I decided to treat all tickets as valid whose sum of invalid values is > 0,
this invalid ticket wasn't filtered out and I got stuck in an endless loop in the evaluation of the fields.

After I had figured that out, the solution was still incorrect! :-(
However this was an easy one: don't use int when multiplying several big numbers!! Switching to long did the trick. :-D
