Proceeded as following to create a list of allergens
* go through all lines once
  * create a Hash with allergen->Array of Arrays with each occurrence of the allergen and possible ingredients it may map to
* loop through all allergens (in the hash)
  * only keep those ingredients that appear in every line the ingredient shows up
* loop through all allergens until each one has been mapped to an ingredient
  * start with allergens with least number of possible ingredients
  * remove all ingredients that have already been mapped to an allergen
  * if only one ingredient is possible -> assign it to the allergen

For the actual part1 just loop through all words and count those that are not allergens.
