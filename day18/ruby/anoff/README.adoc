== Part 1

Implemented a custom calculation method that uses recursion to handle parenthesis.
Because no multi-digit numbers occur in the equation it is easy to treat each character in the string as an opcode.

* remove all spaces
* step through each character
* if it is an operator, store it for next iteration
* when finding a new number, apply the operator with the new number and previous result
* when finding an open parentheses, call function itself with a break condition `stopAtParanthesesClose` that makes it return early in case it finds a closing parenthesis
