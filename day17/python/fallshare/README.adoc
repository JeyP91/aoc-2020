== Day 17: Conway Cubes

Awesome! Conway's game of life in 3D in 4D.

=== Star 1
I went for a pretty itterative approach.
git reset --hard origin/master
[source, python]
....
include::solution_star1.py[]
....

=== Star 2
I decided to create a hard copy of the star 1 functions and enhace them by anohter dimension.
Unfortunatley a missed indentation caused some issues and I lost some time with debugging.

[source, python]
....
include::solution_star2.py[]
